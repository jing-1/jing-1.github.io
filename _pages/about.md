I am a Ph.D. student (2020-) at [Lab. of Intelligent Information Processing](http://iip.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Zhenzhong Chen](http://iip.whu.edu.cn/~zzchen/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
---

I mainly work on designing algorithms that leverage deep probabilistic models, graph neural networks, and causal inference techniques to tackle data mining problems (especially recommendation systems, and multimedia analysis), such as uncertainty, multi-modal fusion, and confounders.

<!-- I have abundant interest in **Graph Mining**, e.g., **Spectral Graph Theory**, **Graph Neural Networks** and corresponding interdisciplinary topics. -->

<!-- My previous research experiences mainly lie in graph mining and feature fusion. -->
